BasicMath class: Add () method

EmilioMath class: Multiply () method

	               Add () method too. because of the inheritance

(with refernce to EmilioClass) Derived Class (extends the Base class: we could add more class members to extend the orginial capabilities)

(with refernce ti BasicMath) Base Class	

Differnet "Types" in the .NET Framework:

Classes

Interfaces
Structures
Enumerations
Delegates

interface IGarciaMath {

	public int Cube (int x);
 }

(with reference to Cube)- We have a method named Cube and its signature but there's no implementation

(with reference to (:) ) - The Savany class implements the IGarciaMath interface: it means that Savany is obeying the contract established with the
 interface by implementing (writing code) the Cube() method. To fully obey the contract Savany has to implement every single property or method
that is on the interface.

"Services" WCF is coded with interfaces and classes

By convention: I ___for Interfaces.

*take aways interfaces(concept) classes are applied in different portions of web developing
